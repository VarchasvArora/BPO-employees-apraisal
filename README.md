Introduction
The project aims to set up a reliable system for evaluating employee performance for an Indian 
subsidiary of a leading BPO organization. This Pune-based subsidiary is newly formed and is only 
a year old and now has more than a hundred people working there. Out of said 99 people, 51 
employees are girls while 48 are boys. The project's main goal is to set up an effective appraisal 
process which is planned to be completed in 7 days.
By the use of many excel tools ,we will be creating a reliable evaluation procedure. This project 
aims to create an environment of open communication and trust among workers. Some of the 
assessment criteria would be the number of tickets resolved, average resolution time, and number 
of customer appreciation and escalations received in the quarter . This project will also evaluate 
the workers according to their performance and compute the daily weighted average score.
 
Methodology
To complete this project various steps were involved with each step utilizing the capabilities of 
Excel.
• Employee List Creation:
An employee list was created, including details such as Employee IDs, First name, 
Surname, Date of Birth, Gender, Date of Joining, and Overall Work Experience (Months).
• Industry Vertical Assignment:
Employees were divided into four industry verticals: Banking, Manufacturing, Core IT 
Support, and Shipping. 
• Work Experience Calculation:
To calculate each employee's work experience (MONTHS) in the current organization 
since the date of joining, the DATEDIF function was utilized. 
• Performance Parameters Entry:
For each performance parameter of No. of tickets of each severity solved and the resolution 
time of tickets in the month of April, May and June each new column was created.
• Daily Weighted Average Score Calculation:
The SUM function was used to find the sum of resolution time and no. of tickets of each 
severity solved in the months of April, May and June. Then by assigning weights and 
calculating their average The Weighted Average was calculated.
• Ranking Scores:
The RANK.EQ function was used to rank all the scores based on the daily weighted average 
score.
• Conditional Formatting:
The project used to highlight top 10% and bottom 10% students based on their rank 
calculated.

The Data Analysis tool was used to calculate the descriptive statistics of Average Daily 
Weighted Score regarding No. of tickets resolved and Average Daily Weighted Score 
regarding Resolution time.

find the number of employees in each project.

Results
Over the course of our evaluation process , we have evaluated 99 employees of the Pune-based 
subsidiary. During this appraisal cycle, the employees were ranked based on their average 
resolution time , No. of tickets resolved and No. of client appreciation and escalations. For each 
employee their daily weighted average score was calculated for number of tickets resolved and 
their resolution time where the tickets of April were given a weight of 0.5 ,tickets of May were 
given a weight of 0.3 and tickets of June were given a weight of 0.2 .
Rankings were then assigned based on 1) Weighted Daily average score of No. of tickets resolved 
2) Weighted Daily average score of resolution time, 3) Client Appreciations and 4) Client 
Escalations. Then overall performance ranking was calculated based on the average of these 4 
rankings.
Descriptive statistics were also calculated which came out as follows: 
Key Findings
After the evaluation process we found that 9 employees were underperforming and 10 employees 
were overperforming.The Employees Arman Diaz,River Russel, Ashley Alexander , Alice 
Rogers,Addison Edwards,Willow Scott, Christopher Gayle,Jack Harris and Megumi Fushiguro 
were underperforming and the supervisor should have a meeting with them to understand the and 
pinpoint the reason for their lack of performance.With additional support and training, they may 
be able to increase their performance .
While the employees Phineas Long ,Saira James , Bella Henderson,Audrey Morgan ,Allen Parker 
,Tom Baker ,Melanie Martinez, Elizabeth Hernandez,Anakin Skywalker and Millie Brown were 
overperforming and should be recognized and acknowledged by giving them a performance bonus 
to motivate them to keep their performance up.It is also crucial to understand the reason behind 
their good performance and whether these can be replicated across the team

Conclusion
In summary, the performance appraisal process has yielded significant insights into the working 
of employees. These observations may have the potential to increase individual and team 
performance which will ultimately lead to more productivity which is going to be beneficial for 
the firm. It is advised to perform this appraisal cycle consistently to monitor the performance of 
the employees and implement required actions
